# NOTICE

* ```HttpClient``` of our SDKs support multi-thread, if you need greater concurrency,
you can create your own ```HttpClient``` and pass it to the constructor of class `ClientFactory`.
(References and examples in ```galaxy-client-java```, ```sds-android-examples```)ï¼š
```ClientFactory(Credential credential, HttpClient httpClient)```

* When compiling ```sds-android-examples```, you must install `Android SDK` and set
environment variable `ANDROID_HOME` to the install path of `Android SDK` before.
Our examples used `Android SDK API Level 19`.
